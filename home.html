          <p>For any of you who've not yet heard of Google, we've put together a bit of info on the
island to give you a head-start.</p>
<p>Santorini (also known as Thira) is part of the Cyclades group of islands in Greece. It was
formed when a massive volcano erupted around 1660 BC and sank into the sea, creating
the Caldera (volcano cauldron) of Santorini, which is now home to many of the amazing
villages with views stretching out across the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>The island is best known for stunning sunsets and scenery, with black sandy beaches
and the famous whitewashed buildings with their cobalt blue rooftops. Whichever way
you look in Santorini it’s pretty much postcard-perfect so keep your camera handy! </p>
<p><strong>Oia</strong> in the north of the island is a picturesque village known for the best views of
Santorini’s romantic sunsets. If you’re single, or the thought of hundreds of doe-eyed
couples watching the sun go down makes you feel a bit sick, you can head further down
the Caldera where the sunsets are equally as gorgeous. </p>
<p><strong>Fira</strong> is the capital, and one of the liveliest villages on the island with plenty of shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. The town is popular with tourists and has plenty of nightlife.</p>
<p><strong>Kamari</strong> and <strong>Perissa</strong> are the beach towns and have a fun and friendly vibe. These are about 30 mins by taxi or bus from Fira. Highlights include an open-air cinema in Kamari
and a waterpark in Perissa.</p>
<p>The island is fairly small (you can drive from North to South in about 45 mins) and it’s
easy to get around; you can rent a car, moped, donkey or skateboard and we’re also
informed they have a really good bus service.</p>
<p>For just about all the info you could ever possibly want (and more) on Santorini check

          <h2>Where to stay</h2>
          <h3>Some tips and advice</h3>
          <p>We will be on the island at least 4 days before the wedding, and will be staying for a
week afterwards so we have time to relax and catch up with those of you staying on for a
holiday! We haven’t yet decided where we’ll be based so we’ll provide an update on here
once we know, but we’ll be renting a jeep so we can get about and see you all. </p>
<p>The wedding ceremony will be held in the capital, Fira, which is about 30 mins by taxi
from the beach towns. There will then be a coach to take everyone to the reception at Theros Wave Bar in the south of the island, and taxis will be ready and waiting later on
in the night once you’re ready to head back to your hotel. </p>
<p>Santorini is a small island so you can choose to be based wherever suits you best, either
in one of the towns along the Caldera with amazing views, the lively capital Fira or the
beach towns towards the southeast. </p>
<p>The towns along the Caldera (Oia, Imerovigli, Fira, Firostefani) all have views out across
the volcano and are good places to watch the sunsets. You’ll find more restaurants, clubs
and shops in these and the hotels are more luxurious and expensive. </p>
<p>If you prefer to stay near the black sandy beaches of Santorini then Perissa and Kamari
are good choices, with a more relaxed, fun vibe and good value accommodation. Perissa
also has a waterpark and there is an open-air cinema in Kamari that has excellent
ratings on tripadvisor.</p>

            <h3>Moo</h3>
            <p>Full name Magic, she's nicknamed Moo due to her black &amp; white features and being
closer to the size of a cow than a cat (and about as graceful!). The furball has owned me
since she was 6 weeks old (11 years now!) and I love her antisocial attitude and air of
indifference. Unfortunately she can't attend the wedding in person but she'll be
watching via webcam from her spot on the sofa.</p>

a feast for 20 and build the BBQ with his bare hands. If he wants to "tinker" with the car
he would strip it to it's bones and then work out how to make it lighter, louder and
faster! Nick is a great mate and the reason Matt sunk his cash into his other love in his life, his TVR. Matt has known Nick since he was at school and unfortunately Matt is the
reason Nick has a chipped tooth...will leave it to him to explain why!</p>

and best mate, first one to get the drinks in, always making people laugh and should be

            <h3>"Tiny" Tim Davies</h3>
            <p>Matthew met Tiny on the Rugby field whilst at Uni "studying". He's single handedly
been the reason for Matt waking up with a hangover almost every birthday since! Been
on many holidays with him and is an amazing mate, he however claims to be a better
dancer - but we all know the truth! </p>

            <h2>Parents</h2>
            <h3>Yvonne &amp; Peter Luxford</h3>
            <p>If you haven't met Yvonne &amp; Peter, you’re in for a treat! Matthew's Mum will know your
life story before the end of the night and Matthew's Dad will most likely be on the stage
singing or making you laugh by the bar. Both have been amazing parents and he
wouldn't be where he is without the love and help they have given him.</p>
